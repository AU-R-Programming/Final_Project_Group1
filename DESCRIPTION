Description: This package provides tools for supervised binary classification using numerical optimization. 
    The package includes functions for estimating the coefficient vector (Î²), initializing values for optimization,
    generating bootstrap confidence intervals, and computing confusion matrix metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity).
    Additionally, it outputs diagnostic metrics such as the False Discovery Rate and Diagnostic Odds Ratio. 
    Detailed documentation is included for all implemented functions.
